[San Jose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California)

* Area of the city is 179.97 square miles
* Population is 1,026,908
* Third Population Density in California and 10th in US

The reason I choose San Jose is because it's my hometown. 

Note: `sample1.osm` is the first file (size: 4MB, k = 100) that I have used to wrangle San Jose dataset. But the final report is based on `sample.osm` (k = 2), which is larger(about 200MB)
